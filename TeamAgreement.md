# Our Team Agreement

## Conflict Plan

Our plan is to avoid conflicts, by making things clear, communicating and planning a head. However, sometimes conflicts are inevitable when it comes to group work. For this reason, we have agreed that when a conflict occurs, the team leader will be responsible for resolving the conflict internally in a diplomatic and just way. If the team leader failed to do so, the instructional team will be asked for help and consultation regarding this matter.

## Communication Plan

The key to any project’s success is done through communication. In order to make sure that each one of us in on the same page, we have decided to agree on some set of rules, as follows:
- Working during weekends and after hours will be upon every team member’s approval.
- Every decision the team will make, will be based on voting.
- Every time a member has the right to share his thoughts, perspectives and ideas regarding any work done.

## Work Plan

We will be using Trello for managing the project, the team leader will be responsible for making sure that each feature task is being delivered on time,according to the pre set time-line on Canvas. 
Each team member will contribute evenly to the work. As a team leader, I will make sure that all team members, including myself, are engaged with work, taking into account that everyone of us will work on both the Front-End and Back-End, to achieve maximum benefit, and the best project outcome.

## Git Process

An organization will be created for the team. The project will be in one repository, each team member will be set as an owner, and will be working on a branch. Such that each feature will have its own branch. The read.me, javaScript files, the sql schema, along with the ejs and css files will be on Github, while other files, such as the .env will be on our machines. Pull Requests will be reviewed daily within a team session meeting, and the team leader will be responsible for merging the approved PRs at the end of that session.
